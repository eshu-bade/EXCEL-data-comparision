# Excel-data-comparision

This Python code reads the data from 2 excel sheets of requirement IDs.

Some IDs exist in both files and this code prints the IDs that doesn't exist in the other file.

The first_excel sheet compares to the second_excel and saves into the Excel file.
The same way, second_excel compares the data to the first_excel sheet data and saves the unique ID into the new file.
